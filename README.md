# Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles for my daily driver desktop setup. For text editing, it has configs for Vim and Visual Studio Code. The desktop environment is i3, and shell is Zsh. The wallpaper i use can be found at, and is made by, https://tabusemio.tumblr.com/post/107312409129/sonic-youth%E3%81%A8kraftwerk. The font for everything is Tewi.
